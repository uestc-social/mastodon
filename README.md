Chuckya is a close-to-upstream soft fork of Mastodon Glitch Edition (more commonly known as glitch-soc) that aims to introduce more experimental features/fixes with the goal of making the overall experience more enjoyable. Although it's mainly developed for and used on the [wetdry.world](https://wetdry.world) instance, it can be deployed by any server admin as a drop-in, backwards-compatible replacement for Mastodon.

Here are some of the changes compared to glitch-soc:

- Emoji reactions (glitch-soc/mastodon#2462)
- Bubble timeline
- Tenor GIF picker (originally from [koyu.space](https://github.com/koyuspace/mastodon), rewritten for Chuckya)
- Mastodon Modern theme (licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0, [original repo](https://git.gay/freeplay/Mastodon-Modern))
- Configurable media attachment limits
- Polls can be posted alongside media (glitch-soc/mastodon#2524)
- Polls can have only one option
- Restores status trend half-life to 2 hours
- Allows dashes in custom emote names
- Emojis can be put side-by-side
- Minor media attachment tweaks

Changes previously in Chuckya that made their way into vanilla Mastodon:

- Unicode emojis use [`jdecked/twemoji`](https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji) v15 graphics (mastodon/mastodon#28404)

Setup instructions are the same as [glitch-soc's](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs); just replace the glitch-soc repo URL with `https://github.com/uestc-social/mastodon`.

Original glitch-soc readme is below.

Mastodon is a **free, open-source social network server** based on [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) where users can follow friends and discover new ones. On Mastodon, users can publish anything they want: links, pictures, text, and video. All Mastodon servers are interoperable as a federated network (users on one server can seamlessly communicate with users from another one, including non-Mastodon software that implements ActivityPub!)

## Features

<img src="./app/javascript/images/elephant_ui_working.svg?raw=true" align="right" width="30%" />

**Part of the Fediverse. Based on open standards, with no vendor lock-in.** - the network goes beyond just Mastodon; anything that implements ActivityPub is part of a broader social network known as [the Fediverse](https://jointhefediverse.net/). You can follow and interact with users on other servers (including those running different software), and they can follow you back.

**Real-time, chronological timeline updates** - updates of people you're following appear in real-time in the UI.

**Media attachments** - upload and view images and videos attached to the updates. Videos with no audio track are treated like animated GIFs; normal videos loop continuously.

**Safety and moderation tools** - Mastodon includes private posts, locked accounts, phrase filtering, muting, blocking, and many other features, along with a reporting and moderation system.

**OAuth2 and a straightforward REST API** - Mastodon acts as an OAuth2 provider, and third party apps can use the REST and Streaming APIs. This results in a [rich app ecosystem](https://joinmastodon.org/apps) with a variety of choices!

## Deployment

### Tech stack

- [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) powers the REST API and other web pages.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is the main database.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org/) are used for caching and queueing.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) powers the streaming API.
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) are used for the dynamic parts of the interface.
- [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) supports testing on real devices and browsers. (This project is tested with BrowserStack)
- [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) provides visual regression testing. (This project is tested with Chromatic)

### Requirements

- **Ruby** 3.2+
- **PostgreSQL** 13+
- **Redis** 7.0+
- **Node.js** 20+
