Chuckya is a close-to-upstream soft fork of Mastodon Glitch Edition (more commonly known as glitch-soc) that aims to introduce more experimental features/fixes with the goal of making the overall experience more enjoyable. Although it's mainly developed for and used on the [wetdry.world](https://wetdry.world) instance, it can be deployed by any server admin as a drop-in, backwards-compatible replacement for Mastodon.

Here are some of the changes compared to glitch-soc:

- Emoji reactions (glitch-soc/mastodon#2462)
- Bubble timeline
- Tenor GIF picker (originally from [koyu.space](https://github.com/koyuspace/mastodon), rewritten for Chuckya)
- Mastodon Modern theme (licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0, [original repo](https://git.gay/freeplay/Mastodon-Modern))
- Configurable media attachment limits
- Polls can be posted alongside media (glitch-soc/mastodon#2524)
- Polls can have only one option
- Restores status trend half-life to 2 hours
- Allows dashes in custom emote names
- Emojis can be put side-by-side
- Minor media attachment tweaks

Changes previously in Chuckya that made their way into vanilla Mastodon:

- Unicode emojis use [`jdecked/twemoji`](https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji) v15 graphics (mastodon/mastodon#28404)

Setup instructions are the same as [glitch-soc's](https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs); just replace the glitch-soc repo URL with `https://github.com/uestc-social/mastodon`.

Original glitch-soc readme is below.

Mastodon is a **free, open-source social network server** based on ActivityPub where users can follow friends and discover new ones. On Mastodon, users can publish anything they want: links, pictures, text, and video. All Mastodon servers are interoperable as a federated network (users on one server can seamlessly communicate with users from another one, including non-Mastodon software that implements ActivityPub!)

## Features

<img src="/app/javascript/images/elephant_ui_working.svg?raw=true" align="right" width="30%" />

**No vendor lock-in: Fully interoperable with any conforming platform** - It doesn't have to be Mastodon; whatever implements ActivityPub is part of the social network! [Learn more](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/why-activitypub-is-the-future/)

**Real-time, chronological timeline updates** - updates of people you're following appear in real-time in the UI via WebSockets. There's a firehose view as well!

**Media attachments like images and short videos** - upload and view images and WebM/MP4 videos attached to the updates. Videos with no audio track are treated like GIFs; normal videos loop continuously!

**Safety and moderation tools** - Mastodon includes private posts, locked accounts, phrase filtering, muting, blocking, and all sorts of other features, along with a reporting and moderation system. [Learn more](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/)

**OAuth2 and a straightforward REST API** - Mastodon acts as an OAuth2 provider, so 3rd party apps can use the REST and Streaming APIs. This results in a rich app ecosystem with a lot of choices!

## Deployment

### Tech stack

- **Ruby on Rails** powers the REST API and other web pages
- **React.js** and **Redux** are used for the dynamic parts of the interface
- **Node.js** powers the streaming API

### Requirements

- **PostgreSQL** 13+
- **Redis** 6.2+
- **Ruby** 3.2+
- **Node.js** 20+

The repository includes deployment configurations for **Docker and docker-compose** as well as specific platforms like **Heroku**, and **Scalingo**. For Helm charts, reference the [mastodon/chart repository](https://github.com/mastodon/chart). The [**standalone** installation guide](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/install/) is available in the documentation.
